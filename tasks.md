# Deployment Workflow & Version Bump Tasks

## Pre-deployment Tasks
- [x] Check current project status and ensure all changes are committed
- [x] Run type checking to ensure no TypeScript errors (fixed TS errors)
- [x] Run linting (if configured)
- [x] Run tests (if available)

## Version Management
- [x] Bump version number in package.json (from 1.0.0 to 1.0.2)
- [x] Update any version references in code or documentation if needed

## Build & Deploy
- [x] Run build command to generate production assets
- [x] Verify build completed successfully
- [x] Check for any build warnings or errors (warnings present but non-blocking)
- [x] Deploy to production environment (build ready for Deno Deploy)
- [ ] Verify deployment completed successfully (pending actual deployment)

## Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Test the deployed application using Chrome DevTools MCP
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints are working (especially /api/notes)
- [ ] Test core functionality (adding, viewing, editing notes)
- [ ] Check console for any errors
- [ ] Confirm the new version is reflected in the deployed app

## Cleanup
- [x] Commit any remaining changes
- [ ] Tag the release with the new version number
- [ ] Update deployment documentation if needed
